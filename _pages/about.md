I am an Assistant Researcher at [NOVA School of Science and Technology](https://www.fct.unl.pt/en) with [NOVA LINCS](https://nova-lincs.di.fct.unl.pt/) and [NOVA Math](https://novamath.fct.unl.pt/).
My main interests include Machine Learning, Optimization, 3D Shape Modelling. I received my PhD in <b>Mathematical Sciences</b> form the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/en) (2022) and BSc and MSc (2018) in <b>Aerospace Engineering</b> from [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/). 
The PhD program was part of  [BIGMATH](http://itn-bigmath.unimi.it/) - an EU funded project in the areas of optimization, statistics, and large-scale linear algebra for Big Data.
My PhD thesis [Gaussian Processes for 3D Shape Modelling of Noisy and Incomplete Data. An Application to Human Ears Reconstruction](https://air.unimi.it/handle/2434/947830), focused on the application of Gaussian Processes 
to 3D shape modelling of challenging point clouds.
