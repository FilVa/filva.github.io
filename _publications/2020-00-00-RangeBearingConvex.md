Abstract 
--------

Hybrid localization in GNSS-challenged environments using measured ranges and angles is becoming increasingly popular, in particular with the advent of multimodal communication systems. Here, we address the hybrid network localization problem using ranges and bearings to jointly determine the positions of a number of agents through a single maximum-likelihood (ML) optimization problem that seamlessly fuses all the available pairwise range and angle measurements. We propose a tight convex surrogate to the ML estimator, we examine practical measures for the accuracy of the relaxation, and we comprehensively characterize its behavior in simulation. We found that our relaxation outperforms a state of the art SDP relaxation by one order of magnitude in terms of localization error, and is amenable to much more lightweight solution algorithms.
